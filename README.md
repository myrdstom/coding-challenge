# Notes

 - Styling is still lacking greatly. This was purely because of the time constraints. Enum mappings have as such not been used and I have mixed up styled components with material ui classes
   
- Application is messy. Ideally the table would be a reusable component and styles and should be in a separate file

- I opted to use material UI as in this case it would help me come up with some components faster but Ideally I should use styled components as per project structure

- In relation to the status generation, I opted to create a function that returns a sorted number of statuses for the status column.
